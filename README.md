# movie-app
This is a React JS application that displays a list of movie shows using data fetched from the TVMaze API. The application allows the user to view the summary of a show and book a movie ticket for it.

# Installation
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the dependencies by running npm install in the project directory.
Start the development server by running npm start.
Navigate to http://localhost:1234 in your browser to view the application.

# Usage
When you launch the application, you will see a list of movies retrieved from the TVMaze API. You can click on a show name to view its summary and book a movie ticket for it.

When you click on a show name, you will be navigated to a new screen that displays the summary of that show. You can then click on the "Book Ticket" button to open a form to book a movie ticket for that show. The form will have the show name pre-filled, and you can enter your details and submit the form to book the ticket.

Your details will be stored in local storage so that they can be retrieved when you visit the form again. To clear your details, you can click on the "Clear Details" button on the form.
